## The BoostServerTech project

This is the first of the [BoostServerTech projects](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZQrod1crs8EaNLLqSYIRMacwR3Rv0hC5l-gfL-jOp2M),
a collection of projects that showcase how C++ and Boost can be used for server-side code.

## Architecture

The server is based on Boost.Beast, asynchronous (it uses stackful coroutines)
and single-threaded. It requires C++17 to build. It uses Redis and MySQL for
persistence.

The client is web-based and uses Next.js. It communicates with the server
using websockets.

You can read more about the architecture
[in this section of the docs](https://anarthal.github.io/servertech-chat/01-architecture.html).

## Local development

You can quickly run the chat application in localhost by using Docker Compose,
by running in a terminal at the repo root:

```
docker compose up --build
```

Or you can learn about how to set up a traditional development environment
[here](https://anarthal.github.io/servertech-chat/02-local-dev.html).

## Going live in minutes

This project features a CI/CD pipeline that can deploy your code to your server in
minutes. All you need is a Linux server with SSH enabled, or an AWS account to create one.
