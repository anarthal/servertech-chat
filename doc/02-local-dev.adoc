= Running the application locally
Rubén Pérez (@anarthal)

Do you want to perform some development?

If you want to try the application locally, make some changes, and see how
it looks like, we recommend using xref:docker-compose[Docker Compose], since
it requires very little setup. If you need IDE integration or debugging,
we recommend xref:local[setting up a development environment].

[#docker-compose]
== Docker Compose

With https://docs.docker.com/compose/[Docker Compose], you can have a local
server and client running in minutes. All you need to do is to install
Docker Compose on your machine.

If you're on Linux, install it with the
https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/[Docker Engine].
Otherwise, you can get it by installing
https://docs.docker.com/desktop/[Docker Desktop].

Once you have it, run the following in the repo root:

[code,bash]
----
docker compose up --build
----

That's it! You can access your local server at http://localhost:8080.
You don't need to install any toolchain or compiler.

If you want to modify your application, change the files you need and re-run
the Composer command. Docker will rebuild the application for you before
launching.

Although this technique works great for a quick test, rebuilds take longer
than using regular local development, and debugging is more difficult.
We recommend xref:local[setting up the required tools locally] if you're
going to go beyond a quick test.

== Setting up local development

Since we're building a pass:[C++] server and a React client, you'll need a bunch of
tools. We recommend using Linux (or WSL if you're on Windows). We provide
installation instructions for Ubuntu, but all tools can be installed on any
other system.

=== Building the pass:[C++] server

The following tools are required:

* A pass:[C++]17 compliant compiler. We recommend
  using gcc 10 (o above), or clang 11 (or above).
* CMake 3.16 or above.
* The OpenSSL development files (C headers and CMake module).
* ICU development files (C headers and CMake module).

If you're on Ubuntu, you can install them using:

[code,bash]
----
sudo apt install g++ cmake libssl-dev libicu-dev
----

You also need Boost. Since Boost.Redis hasn't been fully integrated into Boost
yet, you need to do it manually:

[code,bash]
----
include::../tools/install-boost.sh[]
----

You'll also need a running Redis server. The easiest way to achieve this is
with Docker:

[code,bash]
----
docker run -d --name redis -p 6379:6379  redis:alpine
----

A MySQL server is also required. Again, we recommend using Docker:

[code,bash]
----
docker run -d --name mysql -e MYSQL_ALLOW_EMPTY_PASSWORD=yes -p 3306:3306 mysql:8
----

Now you can build your server using CMake (possibly from your IDE) by running
this from the repository root:

[code,bash]
----
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=$HOME/boost ../server
cmake --build . -j 4
----

To run your webserver:

[code,bash]
----
./main 0.0.0.0 8080 .
----

To run unit tests:

[code,bash]
----
ctest --output-on-failure .
----

=== Running the client

You need Node 16.14 or later to run the client. You can https://nodejs.org/en/download[download it]
or https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager[install it from a package manager].
You will also need https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm[npm]
to install packages.

To verify that these tools are working, use:

[code,bash]
----
node -v
npm -v
----

The next step is to install the Node packages required by the client:

[code,bash]
----
cd client
npm install
----

Finally, you can run a development version of your client by running the
following from `client` directory:

[code,bash]
----
npm run dev
----

This will spawn a development server on http://localhost:3000/ with auto-refresh
enabled (if you edit client files, your code will be hot-reloaded on file save).

The development server will route any incoming HTTP traffic on a URL
matching `pass:[http://localhost:3000/api/(.*)]` to the pass:[C++] server on
`pass:[http://localhost:8080/api/]`. If you're pass:[C++] server is running on
a different port, edit `client/.env.development` accordingly.

This routing ensures that both static files and the API are served from the same
origin (which matches the production behavior), avoiding the problems associated
with cross-origin requests.

To run the client unit tests, `cd` into `client` and run:

[code,bash]
----
npm run test
----

=== Running the server integration tests

Integration tests are written in Python. They verify that the server works
as expected by exercising the API directly. You need the
pass:[C++] server running on port 8080 to execute them - the client is not required.

First, install Python 3 and pip:

[code,bash]
----
sudo apt install python3 python3-pip
----

Then, install the required packages:

[code,bash]
----
sudo pip install -r test/integration/requirements.txt
----

Finally, run the tests:

[code,bash]
----
pytest
----
